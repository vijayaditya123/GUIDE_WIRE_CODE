## Use Case: AI & ML Agent for Predicting and Remediating Kubernetes Cluster Issues
### Phase 1: AI/ML Model for Predicting Kubernetes Issues
 # Problem Statement
 Kubernetes clusters can encounter failures such as pod crashes, resource bottlenecks, and network issues. The 
challenge in Phase 1 is to build an AI/ML model capable of predicting these issues before they occur by analysing 
historical and real-time cluster metrics.
